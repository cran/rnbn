\title{Gets TVKs for a query}
\usage{
getTVKQuery(query = NULL, species_only = TRUE, rec_only = FALSE,
  top = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A query string. This can range from latin binomials to partial english names.}

\item{species_only}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} pTVKs of species are returned (i.e.
sub-species and aggregates are removed). Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{rec_only}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} pTVKs of recommended names are returned (i.e.
synonyms are removed). Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Remember, the pTVK of a synonym is a
taxa with 'recommended' name status.}

\item{top}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} only the top answer is returned. This is what the
gateway thinks you are most likely to be after but may not always be right, use with
care!}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing information on each taxa entry that matches the query
string in rows. ptaxonVersionKey (preferred taxon version key) should be used when
searching for records.
}
\description{
Given a search term this function returns taxon information, including pTVKs,
for the first 25 taxa that match that search on the NBN.

\examples{
