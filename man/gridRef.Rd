\title{Manipulate OSGB or OSNI grid reference string}
\usage{
gridRef(grid = NULL, format = c("sq10km", "sq5km", "tetrad", "sq1km",
  "sq100m", "sq10m"))
}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{the grid reference to be manipulated}

\item{format}{the format you want back. The possibilities are: \code{sq10km},
\code{sq5km}, \code{tetrad}, \code{sq1km}, \code{sq100m}, \code{sq10m}}
}
\value{
a list of class "gridref" with the following contents:
\item{grid}{the original grid reference}
\item{gfmt}{the grid reference string formatted as requested}
\item{system}{the grid reference system, either "OSGB" or "OSNI"}
\item{precision}{the precision of the formatted grid reference in metres}
}
\description{
Extracts grid reference strings at various precisions from the supplied grid
reference string - if possible! For example, if you supply a 1km square
reference \code{TL2998}, then you could get the 10km square \code{TL29}, but
not a 100m square grid reference.

\note{
\bold{Tetrads and 5kms}\cr
Tetrads are 2x2km squares and are often used for mapping distributions at a
the scale of a county or similar sized local area. They are labelled using
the 10km square followed by a single, upper-case letter (since there are 25
tetrads in a 10km square, the letter "O" is not used to avaiod confusion with
zero). For example: \code{TL29S}. Letters are used as follows:\cr

\code{0 +---+---+---+---+---+}\cr
\code{. | E | J | P | U | Z |}\cr
\code{8 +---+---+---+---+---+}\cr
\code{. | D | I | N | T | Y |}\cr
\code{6 +---+---+---+---+---+}\cr
\code{. | C | H | M | S | X |}\cr
\code{4 +---+---+---+---+---+}\cr
\code{. | B | G | L | R | W |}\cr
\code{2 +---+---+---+---+---+}\cr
\code{. | A | F | K | Q | V |}\cr
\code{0 +---+---+---+---+---+}\cr
\code{..0...2...4...6...8...0}\cr

This is named the DINTY system after the letters in the second row of this
table.\cr

5x5km squares (sometimes called "pentads") are used for mapping at a regional
scale. They are labelled using the name of the 10km square followed by two
upper-case letters as follows:\cr

\code{ 0 +----+----+}\cr
\code{ . | NW | NE |}\cr
\code{ 5 +----+----+}\cr
\code{ . | SW | SE |}\cr
\code{ 0 +----+----+}\cr
\code{ ..0....5....0}\cr
}
\examples{
gridRef("TL2998", "sq10km") # Returns TL29
gridRef("TL29", "sq1km") # Returns NULL - you cannot get a 1km from a 10km!
