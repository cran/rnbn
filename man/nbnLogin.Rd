\usage{
nbnLogin(username = NULL, password = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{username}{optional character giving username}

\item{password}{optional character giving password}

\item{verbose}{logical, if \code{TRUE} successful logins are reported via console}
}
\description{
Opens a dialog box for the user to enter credentials if
username and password are not given, also manages cookies.
}
\details{
This function is used within the getOccurrences function and should not
normally need to be used by users. It automatically handles cookies and only
prompts users for username and password if no cookies exist. The facility to provide
a username and password has been added for people who may have issues with cookies
or perhaps share an account with a number of others, however hardcoding usernames and
passwords has obvious security issues.
