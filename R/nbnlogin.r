#' Get Login credentials for NBN access

#' @details This function is used within the getOccurrences function and should not
#' normally need to be used by users. It automatically handles cookies and only
#' prompts users for username and password if no cookies exist. The facility to provide
#' a username and password has been added for people who may have issues with cookies
#' or perhaps share an account with a number of others, however hardcoding usernames and
#' passwords has obvious security issues.
